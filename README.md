# Plot
Plotting of one or more functions expressed using C# code snippits

This is a simple WPF application that uses CodeDomProvider to dynamicaly compile and plot one or more C# expressions.

The functions to be plotted as well as the start and end values to plot are expected to evaluate to a double. The value along the horizontal axis is exposed as the variable 'X' in the function expressions.
